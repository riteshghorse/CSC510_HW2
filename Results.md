# Methods:
* Languages: Scala, Ruby, Go
* Used Google Forms for getting feedbacks
* Manually recorded time for debugging.
* Prevent user from accessing Rosetta Code
* The evaluation method is a 2 part process.
	Post Evaluation form - This form evaluates the familiarity of user with different languages.
*	Manual Observation during debugging
		- Was the user able to find the compilation and logical bug?
		- Time taken to find the bug?
		- Number of times the code was run?
* The final evaluation will be done by congregating the results of manual observation and post evaluation form.

# Material:
* Zoom
* Google forms
* Repl.it

# Observations:

### Proficieny of test subjects in different languages

### Language likely to be used by the user in future projects

# Conclusions:
* Users are more familiar with Ruby as a result it was found that users took less time to solve bugs and also took less tries to solve it. Go is the least familiar language among three.
* Based on observation, users found it easy to solve bugs in Scala followed by Ruby and GO.
* In terms of  readability, it is easy to understand Go followed by Scala and Ruby.
* Majority of users prefer to choose Go for working on project rather than using Ruby and Scala.

# Threats to Validity:
* The level of difficulty of the bug was not uniform across different languages.
* We must dry run our entire process to be sure that the process works
